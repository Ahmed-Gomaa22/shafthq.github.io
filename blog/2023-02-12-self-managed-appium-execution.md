## What is self-managed appium execution?

- One of the common challenges for mobile application test automation is achieving and maintaining a proper testing environment.
- A Testing environment consists of several elements; Android SDK CLI tools, Android System Image, Android Emulator, Support for Hardware acceleration, NPM, Appium 2.x server, drivers and plugins.
- SHAFT will now download, and setup your testing environment.
- SHAFT will also maintain everything in your environment to ensure that it's all up-to-date.
- SHAFT will then initialize the Emulator, initialize the Appium server, and synchronize everything before starting test execution.
