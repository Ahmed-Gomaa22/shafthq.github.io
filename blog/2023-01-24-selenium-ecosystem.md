## What is the Selenium Ecosystem?

- Over the last decade, a large ecosystem of Open Source projects have sprouted up around Selenium.
- The Selenium Ecosystem attempts to capture some of those projects that make use of Selenium WebDriver as a central part of what they do.
- It consists of a number of drivers, bindings, plugins, and frameworks created and maintained by third parties.

## What are some other members of the Selenium Ecosystem?

- [Google ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
- [Microsoft EdgeDriver](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/)
- [WebdriverIO](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio)
- [Nightwatch.js](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch)

## Why use a framework that's part of the Selenium Ecosystem?

- These projects are developed, and maintained by third parties who dedicate their time and efforts to complement the solid infrastructure provided by Selenium WebDriver; the undisputed market leader for test automation since its inception.
